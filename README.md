CleanXcodeObjcTemplates
=======================

Simpler, cleaner iOS objective C class template for Xcode projects, with Doxygen-style headers, some precompiler pragma marks for better organization, etc.

To use:

  1. Clone or download the folder "Simple Style".
  2. Put the folder into this directory: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/
  3. Try adding a new file in a project! If you don't see the Simple Style as an option, restart Xcode.

That should be it!
